**ReacType** is a rapid prototyping tool built on Electron that allows users _visualize_ their application architecture dynamically, employing a _drag-and-drop canvas display_ and an interactive, _real-time component code preview_ that can be exported as a **React** app for developers employing React component architecture alongside the comprehensive type-checking of **TypeScript**. In other words, **you can draw prototypes and export React / TypeScript code!**

### Documentation

If you want to read about using ReacType, the [User Manual](https://reactype-1.herokuapp.com/#/tutorial) is free and available online now.

### Installing

- **MacOS**
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/open-source-labs/ReacType/releases) <br>
After opening the dmg and dragging ReacType into your Applications folder, ctrl+click the icon and select 'Open' from the context menu to run the app. This extra step is necessary since we don't have an Apple developer license yet.
If you are given a warning that Apple could not scan the app. Please follow these [steps](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202491)

- **Windows**
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/open-source-labs/ReacType/releases)


## Changes with version 14.0.0

- **Add event listeners**: Users can now add event listeners to elements in the customization tab and view a list of added events. The list can be edited to remove events, and the live code preview will show the events being added and updated.
- **Delete buttons added**: Delete buttons have been added to canvas components and elements for easier removal. Users can now delete elements or components directly by focusing on them and clicking the delete button.
- **Live code preview and component tree update**: When users drag-and-drop components and elements, the live code preview and component tree are automatically updated to reflect the changes in real time.
- **Major UI changes**: The user interface has undergone a major change, including a sliding effect for the left and bottom panels to maximize user visibility. The styling has been unified and the display of canvas hierarchy has been made more prominent for improved clarity.
- **And more:** See [change log](https://github.com/open-source-labs/ReacType/blob/master/CHANGE_LOG.md) for more details on what was changed from the previous version as well as plans for upcoming features!


## Run ReacType using CLI

- **Fork** and **Clone** Repository.
- Open project directory
- Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```
- If there's any issue with the installation, try using `--legacy-peer-deps` flag instead.

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

- To run the production build

```bash
npm run prod
```

- To run tests

```bash
npm run test
```

- To run the development build

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Please note that the development build is not connected to the production server. `npm run dev` should spin up the development server from the server folder of this repo. For additional information, the readme is [here](https://github.com/open-source-labs/ReacType/blob/master/server/README.md). Alternatively, you can select "Continue as guest" on the login page of the app, which will not use any features that rely on the server (authentication and saving project data.)

- To run the development build of electron app

 ```bash
npm run dev
npm run electron-dev
```

## Run Exported App

- Open exported project directory
- Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

- Build the app

```bash
npm run build
```

- Start an instance

```bash
npm run start
```

- Open browser and navigate to localhost at specified port
