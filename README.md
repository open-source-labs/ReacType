**ReacType** is a visual prototyping tool for developers employing **React** component architecture alongside the comprehensive type checking of **TypeScript**.
In other words, **you can draw prototypes and export React / Typescript code!**

**ReacType** allows the user to _visualize_ their application architecture dynamically, employing a _canvas display_, an _application tree_, and a _real-time component code preview_. The user can create components and load _instances_ of these components, as well as nested HTML elements, onto the canvas. This architecture can then be _exported_ as TypeScript application files to be used as a starter template for any repository.

Download for [MacOS](https://github.com/team-reactype/ReacType/releases/tag/Mac.Version.1.0), [Windows](https://github.com/team-reactype/ReacType/releases/tag/Win.Version.1.0), [Linux](https://github.com/team-reactype/ReacType/releases/tag/Linux.Version.1.0).

- **Mac users**: for now you might need to go to your security settings to allow the app run on your system as we do not have an Apple license yet.

### How to use

- Open the application to start a new project. It will open in the root App component, with its name listed in the left panel and the component represented by the white box on the canvas.
- To add a new component, type its name in the upper left panel, in the field '**Add class component**', and press enter.
- To render a component **_instance_** to the screen, first select the component, or _parent_, that the instance will be rendered within. This selected component will be represented in a new canvas view, with its own white box. Then press the plus button next to the component name. An instance, or _child_, representation will appear on the canvas.
- To add draggable **HTML elements**, select the image icons on the lower left panel.

- The bottom panel allows the user to toggle between 4 different views: a **tree diagram of the application**, a **real-time preview of the exportable code**, a form to enter component props, and a form to add HTML attributes.

- **_Props_** can be added to each component within its tab on bottom panel. Enter in a _key-value pair_, select its data _type_ and press the bottom 'ADD PROP'.
- **_HTML Element Attributes_** of class name and ID can be added to each HTML element after an HTML element has been rendered to the canvas.

- To **_delete_** a _child_ or instance from the canvas, select the desired instance and either press the _delete_ key.
- To **_delete_** a _component_, click the 'DELETE' button of the desired component in the left panel.
- To _start over_, select the blue 'CLEAR WORKSPACE' button in the left panel. This will **clear the entire application**.

### To Export Files

- Once finished setting up the application template, press the green 'EXPORT PROJECT' button at the bottom of the left panel and choose between two options to export your files:
  1. Export the component files into a components folder. This option will allow a developer to add these files to an existing project.
  1. Export a new project with TypeScript config files and the component files. This option will allow a developer to immediately begin a new project.
